# GAN
1. Automation of the Registration Process
Technologies Used:
Selenium WebDriver (Python)
Pytest
ChromeDriver
WebDriverWait for handling dynamic elements
GitHub Actions for CI/CD  
2. BDD Feature File for Registration
In the file FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME_MG.feature, I wrote BDD test scenarios for password validation.
The file is structured using Gherkin syntax with Given-When-Then scenarios.
